## Writing with Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language used to format text in files like this [`README.md`](./README.md), [`CONTRIBUTE.md`](./CONTRIBUTE.md), and example-specific `README.md` files in the subfolders of the [`1_Arduino`](./1_Arduino) folder (e.g., `1_Arduino/LED_neopixel/README.md`). It allows you to add headings, lists, links, images, and more using simple syntax. To learn more about writing and formatting with Markdown on GitHub, refer to the [GitHub Markdown Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#images).
